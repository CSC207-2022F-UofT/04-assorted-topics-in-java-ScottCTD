/* TODO: Create a subclass of Trader named DrivableTrader
 * This class should be identical to Trader, except that it takes
 * only Drivable objects in its inventory, wishlist, etc.
 *
 * The sellingPrice returned should also be overridden. The selling price
 * should be equal to the:
 *     Object's price + Object's max speed
 * If the object is Tradable (and Tradable.MISSING_PRICE otherwise.)
 *
 * Look at DomesticatableTrader.java for an example.
